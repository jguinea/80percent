                  <p class="bg-white bg-opacity-75">This morning I was desperately looking for one of my socks in someone else's house. I searched for  30 minutes until I finally saw it. I saw it reflected in a mirror next to me. I couldn't see myself,  because I wasn't in front of the mirror, and I couldn't see the sock outside the mirror either, it was  out of my angle of vision. I put it on and as I was leaving I thought about all this. </p>
                  <p class="bg-white bg-opacity-75">It made me think of all the times that something has not yet been made visible and yet it exists,  because the idea of an image is powerful even before it has been imagined. If the sock had wanted  to find me, it would have done so even though I was sitting on the sofa, oblivious to the mirror.  Because my reflection is powerful enough, just like his, and now I'm arriving home with both socks  on. How many versions are there of everything that exists? </p>
                  <p class="bg-white bg-opacity-75">The tangible is in crisis, because we don't want to call it "reality". Identity is also in crisis. I guess we are the dopplegang*. </p>
                  <p class="bg-white bg-opacity-75">*Doppelgänger ([ˈdɔpəlˌɡɛŋɐ]ⓘ) is the German word for the ghostly double or evil impersonation of a living person. The word comes from doppel, meaning 'double' and gänger: 'walking'. Its older form,  coined by the novelist Jean Paul in 1796, is Doppeltgänger, 'the one who walks beside'.1 The term is  </p>

              This magazine was born with the purpose of exploring our relationship with images in  contemporaneity, so it seemed inevitable to talk about authorship and appropriation, and of course  talking about these things, there is intrinsically "another" image. 
            </p><p class="bg-white bg-opacity-75" style="color: black;">   
              It also seems inevitable not to talk about creation. So far so good, every time we create we generate  small extensions of ourselves. We imagine words, we generate new images. Writing is strange at times, looking is also strange at times and you get tired of both. Writing seems  higher than speaking, because we don't always do it, and because we do it carefully. You choose  each word better, maybe that's why some people talk about important things on whatsapp. We don't  worry much about looking because we look all the time, on autopilot. Although things change  depending on how we look at them.
